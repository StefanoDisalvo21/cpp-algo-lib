## This is a simple C++ algorithm library meant to learn Algorithms and Data Structure

## About this project
    The project started in **August 2025** and is currently **paused**.  
    An Algorithms library is the first thing I thought to do during the summer before my last High School year because I wanted to do more than all the other high school students but I encountered some difficulties that required me to go back to basis that as an High School student I do not have so I decided to pause it and take all the time to master all the basis. 
    The repo will updated as soon as I learn new related concepts, meanwhile you can finde other active projects in my github account.

## Goals 🎯
    - Learn About Algorithms
    - Learn About Data Structures
    - Learn how to work with git with the aim to be able to help and give contributions in open source projects
    - Learn how to write tests using "Google Test".
