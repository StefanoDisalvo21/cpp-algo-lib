## This is a simple C++ algorithm library meant to learn Algorithms and Data Structure

## About this project
This is the first project I started in the summer before my final year of High School.  
I wanted to explore more advanced topics, but I soon realized that I needed to strengthen my mathematical and algorithmic foundations first.  

The repository will be updated gradually as I learn new concepts.  
The project started in **August 2025** and is currently **paused**.

## Goals 🎯
    - Learn About Algorithms
    - Learn About Data Structures
    - Learn how to work with git with the aim to be able to help and give contributions in open source projects
    - Learn how to write tests using "Google Test".
